# Digital-Clock

Refer to Description for the design overview.

#### Specifications
Design a digital clock that displays the time of the day in hours, minutes and seconds. Make a provision for user to set the time to a desired value. The design has to work with the following inputs and outputs provided by the BASYS3 FPGA board.

• 4 seven-segment displays, each one can display a digit, optionally with a decimal point.

• 5 push-button switches are available, but try to use as few as possible, keeping in mind convenience of the user.
• A 10 MHz clock signal.

Assume a 24 hour format for the time, that is, time would range from 00:00:00 hr:min:sec to 23:59:59 hr:min:sec.
